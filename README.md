Here's a professional and developer-friendly `README.md` for your test generator project:

# 🧠 Role-Based Assessment Generator

Automatically generate tailored assessments for any job role and skillset — in seconds.

---

## 🔍 Context

Recruiters, educators, and course creators often waste days manually crafting assessments for new roles. This leads to:

* Generic, one-size-fits-all tests
* Gaps in skill coverage
* Inconsistent difficulty levels

---

## 🎯 Mission

Build an **automated test generator** that takes in:

```json
{
  "role": "string",
  "skills": ["string", ...],
  "difficulty": "Easy" | "Medium" | "Hard"
}
```

And outputs a fully-formed role-specific assessment, including:

* ✅ 15 multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
* 🧠 5 short-answer questions (SAQs)
* 📄 1 situational mini-case
* 🧩 *(Optional)* 6–8 aptitude questions (e.g., logical reasoning, chart-based analysis)

Each output includes a **skill coverage matrix** and respects the selected difficulty level.

---

## 💡 Example

**Input:**

```json
{
  "role": "Product Analyst",
  "skills": ["SQL", "Product-Metrics"],
  "difficulty": "Medium"
}
```

**Output:**

* MCQs: Joins, window functions, north-star metrics
* SAQs: Write a SQL query, interpret retention curve
* Case: “Diagnose GMV drop after feature launch”
* Aptitude: Chart-based data sufficiency
* Skill Coverage Table: Mapping each item to skill and Bloom’s level

---

## 🧰 Starter Kit (Provided)

The project comes with:

1. 📊 `role_skill_map.csv` — 100+ predefined Role ↔ Skill mappings
2. 📈 Difficulty taxonomy — Based on Bloom’s levels and distractor quality
3. 🧾 JSON Schemas — For `mcq`, `saq`, `case`, and `aptitude` items
4. 🧪 Prompt templates — Optimized with 3 validated reference assessments
